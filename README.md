## üéØ Why Geminal?

Windows has integrated Copilot into its own system, but Linux does not. Therefore, I developed Geminal, a chatbot for
the terminal powered by Google's Generative AI, specifically designed for Linux programmers.

Here's why you might choose Geminal:

* **Focus on your code:** Geminal integrates seamlessly into your terminal, allowing you to ask questions about your
  code without leaving your workflow.
* **Open source and free to use:** Geminal is open source and completely free to use, making it an accessible option for
  all programmers.
* **Fast and efficient:** Geminal utilizes Gemini Pro, a powerful AI assistant, to provide you with accurate and timely
  answers.
* **Tailored to Linux users:** Geminal is designed specifically for Linux users, ensuring compatibility with your
  operating system.
* **Supports multiple languages:** Geminal supports a wide range of programming languages, making it a versatile tool
  for programmers of all backgrounds.
* **Easy to use:** Geminal's intuitive interface and simple commands make it easy to get started and use effectively.
* **Enhances productivity:** Geminal helps you save time and effort by providing instant assistance, allowing you to
  focus on the task at hand.

## üê≥ How to dockerize Geminal as an image to run with Docker _(lowly recommended)_

- **Step 1:** Please make sure that you have installed Docker on your computer before moving on to the next step.


- **Step 2:** Dockerize Geminal as an image.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nhattdm/Geminal.git

cd Geminal

make dockerize
```

- **Step 3:** Run just the created image with Docker.

## üìù Notes

- If you don't have your own GOOGLE API KEY, visit [Makersuite by Google](https://makersuite.google.com/) and create a
  new one for free.
- Use `Tab` or `Alt+Enter` for a newline (multiline input).
- The list of actions that interact with the last response from Gemini Pro will not be available if you run the
  application
  in a container.
- In case you're unable to copy the last message or code block from Gemini Pro to your clipboard, install
  the [`xclip`](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-use-xclip-on-linux) package if you're using a Linux distribution. For
  macOS users, seek a similar solution.
